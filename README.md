# R-Projects

The purpose of this project is to perform exploratory data analyses on the data from the peer-to-peer personal loan service provider called Prosper. Since a borrower's financial health is based on how many loans the borrower carries and the borrower's ability to pay back those loans on time, Prosper uses a variety of criteria to approve personal loans- it ranges from credit score, income level, and debt-to-income ration, to name just a few. Prosper differs from the traditional lenders such as banks or other lending institutions. 

The EDA encompasses mainly the branch of statistics called descriptive statistics - mean, mode, median, and standard deviation. This method is used to find the central tendency and the spread of our dataset.

This project's EDA process is a stepping stone to learn from the historical data of personal loans. Analyzing various variables in the dataset and using statistical methods to glean insights from the dataset,can shade some light on how future borrowers can make better borrowing decisions.
